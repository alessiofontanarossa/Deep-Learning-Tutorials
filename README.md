# Neural-Networks-Tutorials

This repository contains a notebook with basic applications of neural networks. The main sections are:
- Classical ML:
  - Linear Regression:
    - Optimal values (normal equation) by hand;
    - Optimal values (normal equation) with Scikit-learn;
    - Gradient Descent using PyTorch from scratch;
    - GD using optimizer;
- Fully-connected nn:
  - One hidden layer (shallow) nn, binary;
  - MNIST (binary, 1 and 7);
  - MNIST (all numbers, multi classification);
- CNN:
  - MNIST (all numbers, multi classification);
- Autoencoders:
  - denoising MNIST (all numbers, multi classification) with PCA;
- Reinforcement Learning (to be completed)
