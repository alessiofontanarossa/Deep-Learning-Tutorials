# Deep Networks tutorials

This repository contains a set of notebooks with basic applications of neural networks, both with PyTorch and Keras/TensorFlow, to illustrate the use of these libraries. The PyTorch notebooks, which start with (PT), are more complete; instead the TensorFlow notebooks (TF) are taken from the [Coursera specialization](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-deep-learning-with-pytorch-keras-tensorflow).

The content of the notebooks is as follows:

TO BE UPDATED
- Classical ML:
  - Linear Regression:
    - Optimal values (normal equation) by hand;
    - Optimal values (normal equation) with Scikit-learn;
    - Gradient Descent using PyTorch from scratch;
    - GD using optimizer;
- Fully-connected nn:
  - One hidden layer (shallow) nn, binary;
  - MNIST (binary, 1 and 7);
  - MNIST (all numbers, multi classification);
- CNN:
  - MNIST (all numbers, multi classification);
- Autoencoders:
  - denoising MNIST (all numbers, multi classification) with PCA;
- Reinforcement Learning (to be completed)
